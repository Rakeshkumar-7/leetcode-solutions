# My Leetcode Solutions

Update: The extension is buggy and has issues ever since Leetcode's new UI update. Guess I'll wait till they fix it. Till then, this repo is not upto date

- Started tracking from 01-01-2023(DD/MM/YYYY). So it doesn't include all the problems that I've solved before this date
- The solution files are generated by <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi/related?hl=en" target="_blank">Leethub Chrome extension</a>
- My leetcode profile: <a href="https://leetcode.com/rakeshks7/" target="_blank">rakeshks7</a>
- Most solutions(if not all) will be in Java since I prefer it

Note: Some GFG Solutions might also be there since I(rarely) use GFG to solve problems as well
